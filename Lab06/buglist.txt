Bug List for Queue
    1.) Enqueue does not add to the back of the queue. Based on the battery of tests
it seems to add to the front instead.
    2.) The destructor does not remove any items in the queue causing memory
leaks. As part of this each node does not delete any content attached to it on
its own, this isn't necessarily bad unless the queue depended on the node doing
so.
